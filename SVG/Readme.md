This folder contains files necessary to build an adjustable stand that will support multiple boards (but you may just wish to blu-tack them to your piano).

"Clips.svg" contains paths to laser-cut several clips from 3mm thick material, which attach to the slave PCBs with short M3 nuts & bolts. These clips will rest on a 50mm x 3mm x (required keyboard length) piece of aluminium. The clips have a small amount of adjustability.

"Stands.svg" contains paths to make a basic stand to hold the aforementioned piece of aluminium.

"Pedal sensor mount.svg" contains paths to cut a simple mount for sustain pedal sensor. We were using an IR reflection sensor board (ADDRESS) to sense the position of the pedal, but you may wish to use another solution.
